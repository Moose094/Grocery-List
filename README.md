# Grocery-List
The application will allow a user to enter a list of grocery that they would like to purchase. 

They will be able to click on each grocery purchased by clicking on the individual item. 

A cross sign will appear in front of each item which will allow the users to delete item once itâ€™s completed. The progress will be saved anytime the user closes or re-opens the application/browser.
